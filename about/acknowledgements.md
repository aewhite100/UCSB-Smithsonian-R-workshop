#### Primary Contributors

This 6-week workshop was organized by the [Smithsonian Data Science Lab](https://datascience.si.edu/) and the [University of California Santa Barbara Office of Education Partnerships](https://oep.ucsb.edu/) as part of the [UCSB-Smithsonian Scholars program](https://oep.ucsb.edu/programs/smithsonian_scholars_project/). The course materials and this website were both adapted from materials originally created by [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) and [Zachary Brym](http://zackbrym.weecology.org/). See their [contributors page](https://github.com/datacarpentry/semester-biology/graphs/contributors) for more details.
